    "\n",
    "#### 1. Main Objective:\n",
    "   - To develop a robust cryptocurrency price prediction model:**\n",
    "     - Implement a machine learning model using Keras and TensorFlow that accurately predicts cryptocurrency prices.\n",
    "     - Focus on capturing complex patterns and trends within the market to enhance the model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Secondary Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **To evaluate model performance and generalization:**\n",
    "     - Assess the performance of the developed model on historical data not used during training (validation set).\n",
    "     - Employ appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) or root mean square error (RMSE), to measure the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **To explore feature importance and insights:**\n",
    "     - Analyze the importance of different features in the model's predictions.\n",
    "     - Gain insights into the factors driving cryptocurrency price movements, potentially identifying key indicators for future predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. To explore and identify the most volatile cryptocurrency:\n",
    "**Identify the Most Volatile Cryptocurrency:**\n",
    "  - Analyze price volatility over time to identify the cryptocurrency exhibiting the highest degree of price fluctuations.\n"
